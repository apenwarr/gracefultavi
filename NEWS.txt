  WikkiTikkiTavi version 0.21 is released.  Several bug fixes (including a
  security fix) and several minor new features, such as HTML anchors;
  arbitrary link text for free links; RSS syndication; the use of style
  sheets and XHTML-Strict markup; compatibility with register_globals=off;
  the option to split words in page titles, headers, and links; and a time
  zone preference for visitors.

  Users should note that the transclude syntax, %%PageName%%, has been
  deprecated for this release.  It is superseded by the
  [[Transclude PageName]] macro.  The double-% syntax will be removed
  as of version 0.30.

  WikkiTikkiTavi has had a CVS reorganization, intending to bring it to a
  more "normal" state (as defined by common CVS usage conventions).
