Upgrade Notes
-------------

1.  Backup your database. When upgrading from a previous version of
    GracefulTavi, it is strongly recommended to do a full backup of your wiki
    database. GracefulTavi now includes an automated script that will smoothly
    upgrade your database from any old format. It has been tested against all
    previous versions of GracefulTavi with no trouble, but this is just a
    precaution. If anything wrong was to happen to your data during the
    automated upgrade process, please let us know.

2.  Because GracefulTavi is highly customizable, it is necessary sometimes that
    some upgrade tasks must be performed manually. Visit our web site
    http://open.nit.ca/wiki/?GracefulTavi and see each Release Notes from the
    version you are currently using to the one you're upgrading to. See the
    section MANUAL UPGRADE in each Release Notes to learn about any new
    configuration changes that you must perform manually.


GracefulTavi - Installation
---------------------------

1.  Choose a location in which to install GracefulTavi. You do not need to
    install GracefulTavi under your webspace; in fact, it is recommended that
    you do not do so. This is best for security purposes to leave as few scripts
    exposed to the web as possible.

    Additionally, if you install GracefulTavi in a central location, you can use
    it once for multiple wikis on your web server. This makes administration of
    virtual hosts or wiki farms much simpler. Upgrading to a later version of
    GracefulTavi also is simplified, as you can upgrade multiple wikis in one
    step.

    For the sake of example, the following assumes that you have chosen to
    install GracefulTavi in the following directory:

      /usr/local/lib/gracefultavi/

    Alternatively, you can install GracefulTavi directly in your webspace and
    use it without complication; there is no reason that GracefulTavi *must* be
    installed in a central location, although it is recommended.

2.  Download the GracefulTavi archive into the installation directory. You can
    find it at http://open.nit.ca/wiki/?DownloadReleases

3.  Unpack the archive in the installation directory.

4.  Run install/create-db.pl to create the database tables for your wiki:

    Its first parameter is the name of the wiki.

    Its second parameter should be the name of the (already created) MySQL
    database where the tables will be created. If you have not yet created the
    database, you should do so before running the script.

    Its third and fourth parameters are the user name and password to use to
    access the database.

    Optionally, you can include a fifth parameter to specify a prefix to be
    prepended to the table names. If you have access to only one MySQL database,
    you can use this feature to install multiple wikis in the same database.

    You may also include a sixth parameter to specify the hostname or IP address
    of the database server, if it is not the local host.

    Examples:

      perl ./create-db.pl JoeWiki wiki joe passwd
      perl ./create-db.pl SallyWiki project sally pass wiki_ db.example.com
      perl ./create-db.pl JimWiki common jim key "" mysql.example.com

5.  In the install/ directory, run the "configure.pl" script to generate a
    configuration file for your wiki. It takes one parameter, the location of
    the configuration file. For example:

      perl ./configure.pl /home/u/user12/gracefultavi/config.php
      perl ./configure.pl ../config.php

    You will be prompted for such things as the URL to the wiki script, the name
    of your wiki, database information, etc.

    As with the GracefulTavi source, it is recommended that you keep your
    configuration file in a location that cannot be accessed from the web. We
    recommend to put it in the directory where GracefulTavi has been installed
    (see Instllation step 1. above).

    You may wish to double-check the 'config.php' file that was created by the
    configuration script, to make sure that the settings are correct.

6.  If you installed GracefulTavi in your webspace, then skip this step, since
    index.php is already accessible from the web.

    A. Now you have to create an entry point to your wiki. Choose a directory in
       your webspace to be the base point for your wiki. For sake of example, we
       will use /home/joe/public_html/mywiki/.

    B. Create a subdirectory named 'admin/' in this directory. E.g.,
       /home/joe/public_html/mywiki/admin.

    C. In the base directory, create a symbolic link to the index.php in the
       GracefulTavi installation. For example, create
       /home/joe/public_html/mywiki/index.php that is a link to
       /usr/local/lib/gracefultavi/index.php.

    D. In the admin/ subdirectory, create a symbolic link to the index.php in
       the admin subdirectory in the GracefulTavi installation. For example,
       create: /home/joe/public_html/mywiki/admin/index.php that is a link to
       /usr/local/lib/gracefultavi/admin/index.php.

7.  Configure your script so that it can access the GracefulTavi scripts and so
    that it can access your configuration file. If you have installed
    GracefulTavi in your webspace, and you have placed the config.php file in
    the root of that location, then you can skip this step. Otherwise, continue:

    A. Locate the directories for the web space, for your config.php file, and
       for your GracefulTavi installation. For example, they might be:

         /home/joe/public_html/mywiki
         /home/joe/
         /usr/local/lib/gracefultavi/

    B. If you are running PHP as mod_php under Apache, add the directories to
       the .htaccess file in the directory where the wiki resides. Separate them
       with colons:

         php_value include_path "/home/joe/public_html/mywiki:/home/joe/:/usr/local/lib/gracefultavi/"

    C. If instead you are running PHP as a CGI program, or on a Net Integrator,
       then you will have to similarly change the include_path in your php.ini
       file to point to the given directories.

8.  [Optional, but recommended.]

    Turn off register_globals for GracefulTavi. This is generally a good idea to
    make your scripts less liable to undiscovered exploits.

    A. If you are running PHP as mod_php under Apache, add the following line to
       the .htaccess file in the directory where the wiki resides:

         php_flag register_globals off

    B. If, instead, you are running PHP as a CGI program, or on a Net
       Integrator, then you will have to similarly change the register_globals
       setting in your php.ini file.

9.  Visit your wiki and start creating pages!

Additionnal Features - For Advanced Users
-----------------------------------------

-  Login system using Apache authentication

   1. Go to the wiki directory in your web space.

   2. If you installed GracefulTavi in your webspace (see Installation step 6.
      above), then skip this step.

      Remove the index.php symbolic link and copy the file from the GracefulTavi
      installation, /usr/local/lib/gracefultavi/index.php in our example.

   3. Edit the index.php file, it should look something like this:

      <?php
      $_SERVER[PHP_AUTH_USER]="";
      require('lib/main.php');
      ?>

   4. Create a subdirectory named 'login'. In this subdirectory:

      A. Create a symbolic link to the index.php in the GracefulTavi
         installation. For example, create
         /home/joe/public_html/mywiki/login/index.php that is a link to
         /usr/local/lib/gracefultavi/index.php. You might need to chown the file
         to the user or team in which GracefulTavi is installed.

      B. Create these symbolic links:

         images --> ../images
         attachments --> ../attachments

      C. Create (or edit) an ".htaccess" file containing something like this:

         AuthUserFile <path to the .htpasswd file> <--- this line is optional
         AuthName "<Your Wiki Name>"
         AuthType Basic
         require valid-user

      D. Create a subdirectory named 'admin'. In this subdirectory, create this
         symbolic link: index.php -> ../../admin/index.php


-  Attach macro

   The Attach macro is installed by default. It doesn't need any switch to be
   turned on as the presence of the Attach.php file in the macros directory is
   sufficient to activate it. However, it requires a little touch of the system
   administrator to be fully operational.

   1. Go to the wiki directory in your web space.

   2. If you installed GracefulTavi in your webspace (see Installation step 6.
      above), then skip this step.

      Create the following subdirectory:

        attachments
        attachments/.deleted

   3. Both subdirectories must be writable by the user or process running PHP.
      This means they either need to be publicly writable (chmod 777) or have
      the SUID permission (chmod g+s).


-  Remote Pages, aka as Twin Pages, or SisterWiki

   This feature is useful when you want to link your wiki pages to pages with
   the same name on other wikis. When setted up, links to the remote pages
   appear next to the title at the top of the page.

   Take a look at the install/crosswiki.sh file. It is provided with
   GracefulTavi only as an example and requires to be configured independantly
   from the GracefulTavi config.php file mentionned above in the installation
   procedure. It is recommended to set it up as a cron job so the database is
   updated regularly.

   The 6th parameter of the putwiki function, called RESTRICTED, is a boolean
   value (either 0 or 1). When set to 1, the remote pages links will be visible
   only to logged in users.
