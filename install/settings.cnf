// config.php
//
// This file was generated by the install/configure.pl script based
// on values entered by the administrator.  It contains the most
// common (and vital) configuration parameters for WikkiTikkiTavi to
// run.
//
// You may edit this file by hand or use configure.pl to generate a
// new copy.
//
// Certain other settings may be configured; look in lib/defaults.php
// to see them.  Rather than changing them in lib/defaults.php, you
// should copy them from there to here.  The settings here will safely
// over-ride those in lib/defaults.php.
----
string $Admin ''
Enter the administrator's e-mail address.  This address will be printed
in error messages so wiki visitors can contact the administrator if a
problem occurs.
// $Admin specifies the administrator e-mail address used in error messages.
----
boolean $DBPersist 0
Should persistent database connections be used?  Not all hosting providers
allow persistent connections, so you should check before you turn this on.
// If $DBPersist is not 0, persistent database connections will be used.
// Note that this is not supported by all hosting providers.
----
string $DBServer ''
Enter the host name or IP address of your database server.  If it is the
local host, you may leave it blank.
// $DBServer indicates the hostname of the database server.  It may be
// set to '' for the local host.
----
string $DBName ''
Enter the name of the database to be used by the wiki.
// $DBName indicates the name of the database that the wiki should use.
----
string $DBUser ''
Enter the name of the database user.
// $DBUser indicates the name of the database user.

string $DBPasswd ''
Enter the password for database access.
// $DBPasswd indicates the password to use for database access.
----
string $DBTablePrefix ''
Some hosting providers only allow you to have a single database.  In order
to run multiple wikis in a single database, you have to make sure their
table names don't conflict.

'Tavi allows you to specify a 'table prefix' to be prepended to the table
names for each wiki.  For example, one wiki's prefix might be 'project_',
while another's might be 'personal_'.

Enter the table prefix you wish to use for this wiki.  You may leave it
blank for no prefix.
// $DBTablePrefix is used to start table names for the wiki's tables.  If your
// hosting provider only allows you one database, you can set up multiple
// wikis in the same database by creating tables that have different prefixes.
----
string $WikiName ''
Enter the name of your wiki.  This will appear in the browser title bar.
Typically, it is a WikiName, such as AcmeProjectWiki.
// $WikiName determines the name of your wiki.  This name is used in the
// browser title bar.  Often, it will be the same as $HomePage.
----
string $HomePage ''
Enter the 'home page' of your wiki.  This is the wiki page that is the
default page if no page name is given.  It is almost always a WikiName,
such as AcmeProjectWiki.  Usually, it is the same as your wiki name.
// $HomePage determines the "main" page of your wiki.  If browsers do not ask
// to see a specific page they will be shown the home page.  This should be
// a wiki page name, like 'AcmeProjectWiki'.
----
string $InterWikiPrefix ''
Enter the inter-wiki prefix for your wiki.  This is the prefix that you
suggest other wikis use when they link to your wiki.  For example, an
inter-wiki prefix of 'AcmeProject' will yield inter-wiki links of the
form AcmeProject:WidgetBrainstorming.

Typically the inter-wiki prefix is a variation of your wiki name.
// $InterWikiPrefix determines what interwiki prefix you recommend other
// wikis use to link to your wiki. Usually it is similar to your WikiName.
----
boolean $EnableFreeLinks 1
Would you like free links to be enabled on your wiki?  Free links are links
of the form '((my page))', and allow you to escape the confines of the
traditional WikiName syntax.
// If $EnableFreeLinks is set to 1, links of the form "((page name))" will be
// turned on for this wiki.  If it is set to 0, they will be disallowed.
----
boolean $EnableWikiLinks 1
Would you like traditional wiki links to be enabled on your wiki?
Traditional links are of the form 'WikiName'.  It is recommended that
you leave traditional wiki links enabled on your wiki.

Note that you should enable free links if you wish to disable traditional
links.  If you disable both, then users will not be able to create links
of any form to other pages on your wiki.
// If $EnableWikiLinks is set to 1, normal WikiNames will be treated as links
// in this wiki.  If it is set to 0, they will not be treated as links
// (in which case you should be careful to enable free links!).
----
string $ScriptBase ''
Enter the fully-qualified URL for the wiki script you have installed.

For example, you might enter 'http://example.com/wiki/index.php'.
// $ScriptBase determines the location of your wiki script.  It should indicate
// the full URL of the main index.php script itself.
----
string $AdminScript ''
Enter the fully-qualified URL for the administration script for this wiki.

For example, if the wiki script itself is located at the URL
'http://example.com/wiki/index.php', then your admin script will be
located at 'http://example.com/wiki/admin/index.php'.
// $AdminScript indicates the location of your admin wiki script.  It should
// indicate the full URL of the admin/index.php script itself.
----
string $WikiLogo ''
Enter the URL for your wiki's logo.

For example, this might be 'http://example.com/logo.png', or it might be
'/images/jpeg/wiki.jpg'.

If you don't have a logo ready right now, you can use the following logo
for the time being and go back and edit config.php later when you have
your own logo ready:

  http://tavi.sourceforge.net/tavi.png
// $WikiLogo determines the location of your wiki logo.
----
string $MetaKeywords ''
Enter a list of keywords that describe your wiki, separated by spaces.
These keywords will be reported in a <meta> tag to aid search engines that
index your wiki.

// $MetaKeywords indicates what keywords to report on the meta-keywords tag.
// This is useful to aid search engines in indexing your wiki.
----

----
noprompt_var $AdminEnabled 0
// !!!WARNING!!!
// If $AdminEnabled is set to 1, the script admin/index.php will be accessible.
//   This allows administrators to lock pages and block IP addresses.  If you
//   want to use this feature, YOU SHOULD FIRST BLOCK ACCESS TO THE admin/
//   DIRECTORY BY OTHER MEANS, such as Apache's authorization directives.
//   If you do not do so, any visitor to your wiki will be able to lock pages
//   and block others from accessing the wiki.
// If $AdminEnabled is set to 0, administrator control will be disallowed.
